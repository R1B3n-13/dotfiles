## Current Project Context

**CRITICAL**: Before doing ANY work, you MUST first read the current project: @ .gemini/current_project. The project
name in that file indicates which specific project directory within this suit you should work in.

## Code Implementation Rules

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT write code or make file changes immediately. Always follow this workflow:

1. **Understand** the request first
2. **Ask for confirmation** before:
    - Writing any code
    - Creating new files
    - Modifying existing files
    - Making any changes to the project structure
3. **Wait for explicit approval** from the user
4. Only after receiving confirmation, proceed with implementation

## Confirmation Format

When you're ready to implement, ask something like:

-   "Should I proceed with implementing [specific changes]?"
-   "Would you like me to create/modify [specific files]?"
-   "Ready to start coding? I'll be making changes to [list files/areas]."

Always get a clear YES before writing code or making changes.
