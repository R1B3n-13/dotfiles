Please create a detailed plan for this task/project. DO NOT write any code or start implementation yet - just the plan.

Save the plan as a markdown file in the following location:
!{mkdir -p .gemini/plan && echo ".gemini/plan/plan_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).md"}

The plan should be comprehensive and include relevant sections such as:
- Overview and objectives
- Key requirements or considerations
- Approach and methodology
- Steps or phases
- Potential challenges and solutions
- Any other relevant planning details

Focus only on planning and documentation.
